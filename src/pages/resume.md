After graduating from a one year long bootcamp as a full-stack web developer, I made the not-so-obvious choice to go and work as a C developer on safety critical embedded software. The web remained a passion of mine though, so I kept myself up-to-date on the latest cutting edge web technologies, methods and patterns besides my day job, by continuously learning and  experimenting with new stuff.  Earlier this year I finally decided to go through with it and switch to working full time on creating experiences on the web in my favorite languages, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I specialize in React.
